    <p id="intro">
      After four months of lockdown and home Quarantine in Srinagar, I finally got the chance to break the bars and set on a journey to Verinag. It is a small town located in South Kashmir and to give you a shiver in Anantnag district, which usually catches the headlines of the news due to the frequent encounters that take place there between the security forces and militants. But we luckily didn't encounter any such encounter.

  <h3>The Journey - As beautiful as Destination </h3>

  <p>The journey started in the late hours of Saturday morning the temperature was ambient. Still, the scorching rays of the Sun made everything gleam but gave us a burning sensation. Summer is in full bloom in the Kashmir valley, and so is the greenery. On the way through NH-44 named Kashmir Kanyakumari highway connecting the two extreme ends of the nation, one could cherish mesmerising scenes glittering green paddy fields set against the backdrops of rocky Himalayan mountains. Just after a few kilometres, we passed by Pampore, which is famous for the most precious and expensive and delicate spice Saffron, The pride of Kashmir. Pampore is also known as ‘The Saffron Town’ because of the most exceptional quality of saffron produced here. It was not a bloom season for Saffron the red soil fields of Kesar grew like a carpet, and green almond trees stood interspersed between them. Low back mountains bordered the horizon, and in the distance, giant chinar trees created rich rows. The walnut trees were laden with new delicate branches and fruits, and a gentle touch of green came from the willows, which drooped close to the fields. Enroute you can also find many factories manufacturing cricket bat from the finest Kashmiri willows and shops selling the product. If you are looking for pure, local and good quality Saffron and dry fruits you can purchase them from the shops by the highway, although the price is quite high but believe me that you are purchasing an authentic product.</p>

  <h3>Spotting the Spot of Pulwama Attack </h3>

  <p>
    This highway had witnessed a dark scar not only on the road but on the security of our country. On 14 February 2019, a Jaish suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into a bus of CRPF jawans in Pulwama district. Forty CRPF jawans were martyred in that explosion. It had also rendered a hole on the road which is still distinguishable even after it has been filled. The journey may take more time than it must as whenever there is an army movement or convoy the civilian vehicles are stopped due to security reasons. This could be your only irritating part of the journey.

  <h3>Stay at 760 BRTF</h3>
  <p>
    After 2 hours of drive, we reached our destination in Verinag Headquarters of 760 Border Road Task Force (abbreviated as BRTF), an Engineering Force unit that has old and strategic importance. It was the vision of Jawahar Lal Nehru, the first prime minister of India and a Kashmiri Pandit by descent wanted his motherland Kashmir to be connected to rest of India. But being surrounded by mountains makes it inaccessible and disconnected, especially during winter when heavy snow blocks the road. Therefore to ensure connectivity, a tunnel had to build cutting the hard rocks of the Himalayas. India was an infant nation in the 1950s and lacked necessary technology, machinery, and engineers to accomplish this mammoth task. Our Nehru chacha was still very ambitious about this project, so he sought help from Germany. Hence the German engineers and machinery came to India to dig the connecting path between the mainland and the valley and finally the great Jawahar Tunnel was inaugurated in 1956.</p> 

    <div  class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="images/SAM.jpg"  data-recalc-dims="1" ><p class="wp-caption-text">Jawahar Tunnel</p></div>
<p>You all might be thinking that- “ where this 760 BRTF went in all this?”.The tunnel is currently managed and maintained by 760 BRTF. The place where Headquarters of 760 BRTF is situated was chosen and developed by German engineers as their stay during the construction period of the tunnel. I agree that Germans had a bad taste for food but for scenic beauty, they didn’t compromise for anything, which speaks the mesmerising view from Verinag. The sight of dense green mountains at 6000ft with refreshing cool breeze makes it an ideal place to spend your summer. Like other army units, this one also had a multitude of activities to explore yourself and stay lively. As per one’s interest, he can play table tennis or billiards or join a team of high spirited Jawans to play volleyball or cricket. As the sun sets behind the mighty Himalayas, the mercury began to fall and slowly and the night spread her arms to cover the sky with darkness.</p>

  <h3>Sunrise - a view beyond expression</h3>

  <div  class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="images/Sunrise.jpg"  data-recalc-dims="1" ><p class="wp-caption-text">Sun peeping through clouds</p></div>

  <p>Next morning I deliberately started my day early at five o clock because I didn’t want to miss the sunrise and believe me it was much more rewarding than the sleep I had to give up. The sun surrounded by the army of small and scattered clouds peeped through the mountains and spread its golden blessings in the sky. The colourful and exotic birds sang a welcome song for the sun which was so sweet that even sun couldn’t refrain from it and started making his full appearance, making mountains, fields and everything that touched it rays gleam like gold.</p>

  <h3>Mughal Gardens Verinag - The Magnificent origin of Jhelum River</h3>
   <div  class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="images/verinag1.jpg"  data-recalc-dims="1" ><p class="wp-caption-text">Octagonal channel from which the Jhelum Originates</p></div>
  <p>
    After breakfast, we headed towards Verinag Mughal Garden, the origin point of Jhelum. The Jhelum is as pious for Kashmiris as The  Ganga is for the people living in Northern plains. The arable, fertile and constant supply of the potable water, which makes life possible in the valley gives you no reason not to be thankful to her. The river rises from an underground spring which had been constructed as an octagonal well surrounded by domed pavilions with arched entry gates. Under the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, a lover of art his most exceptional architect had completed this monument not only with finest and detailed art but also by using scientific principles that these rooms remain pleasant even in extreme cold and scorching sun. The spring water changes colour with season and position of Sun and is endowed with a natural temperature control system. The more it will be hotter outside the cooler it becomes, and if it’s freezing cold outside, you will find the water quite warm. In the crystal clear water, you can see the floor and the fishes. The garden Westfield plethora of flowers filling the air with their aroma,  The grand chinar trees with thick stems dating back to the Mughal era trees provided an ideal place to escape from burning sun under its dense and broad canopy and enjoy a cooling ice cream. At the end of the park on the right, you will find narrow channels with freshwater circulating from the river for raising the rare and precious trout fish for consumption.</p>

<p>It could have been mistaken as heaven on earth except for the occasional faint gunshots from the nearby army training academy. It broke my reverie, bringing me back to reality and today as the bone of contention war goes on, I can only pray for the restoration of peace. Kashmir is indeed heaven on Earth,  if only the bloodshed would stop.</p>
